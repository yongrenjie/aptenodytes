This package contains various **personal** functions, modules, etc. intended for use with the `penguins` package (https://github.com/yongrenjie/penguins). Its sole job is to make analysing my PhD data easier.

Up until penguins version 0.4.0 these functions were in the `penguins.private` module, but I have removed them since they really shouldn't be lumped into `penguins` itself.

Use this at your own risk!
